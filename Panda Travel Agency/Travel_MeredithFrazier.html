            Easy To Get To, Very Enjoyable For Art, Walking, And Getting Away From The City!</b> <br />
            When you have seen Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and other big places on your Japan vacation, do yourself a huge favour and check out the part of Japan that is a bit quieter and relaxed. You will be glad you did.
